            I hired Jedds to remove an old Sugar maple from a narrow yard. 
            They did the job with no damage to my garage and cleaned it all up 
            that same day. Great service.

            Jedds Tree Care promptly came to examine a downed tree and provide 
            an estimate for its removal. They did the job fast and at the lowest bid. 
            I'll call them again without hesitation for future lawn and garden needs.

            Their team took down five trees in one day and did an immaculate clean-up. 
            They took extra care not to disturb my lawn and garden. I highly recommend 
            their service.

        <!---5. Go to the jtc_pages.txt file in your text editor. The first section in the file contains 
            comments made by Jedds Tree Care customers. Copy the text of the three reviews including the reviewer names. 
            Then, go to the jtc_index.html file in your HTML editor and paste the copied text within the aside element.
                a. Directly after the opening <aside> tag, insert an inline image for the jtc_comments.png file. Specify Comments as 
                    the alternate text. 
                b. Enclose each of the three reviewer comments within a blockquote element, including both the text of the quote and the 
                    name of the review. 
                c. Within each of the three blockquote elements,
                    i. mark the review as a paragraph. 
                    ii. mark the line containing the reviewer name as a cite element.
                    iii. replace the “---” text with the em dash character (—) using the character reference name mdash.
